# OfflineHandwrittenSignatureVerification
An offline handwritten signature verification model built using twin Siamese Neural Networks

The following project uses twin Siamese Neural Networks to classify handwritten signature images are real/forged. The Siamese Network ensures that the system is writer-independent.
